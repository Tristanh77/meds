# Med Tracker App

We provide a user friendly place for the user to keep track of the medicine they take. Simply enter the medication name, quantity, when taken, expiration date, and instructions. That info will then be stored in a database. The user will only be able to access their own medications. Our mission is to eliminate a user ever forgetting whether they took their medication or how much they have taken.
